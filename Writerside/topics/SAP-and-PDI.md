# SAP and PDI

<p>The steps provide functionality to combine PDI capabilities with SAP data. With their help, it is possible to
        edit, analyze and enrich data from SAP systems more broadly and easily. Communication with SAP is
        done with Remote Function Calls (RFC). RFC is an SAP procedure for calling functions in remote systems.
        Each SAP database selects a set of predefined and possibly additional functions. RFC make it possible to
        extract data from the database and make it available for further use.
</p>
<p>The implementation of the steps take place in Java and use the SAP Java Connector (SAP JCo). SAP JCo
        and thus the steps support any SAP (R/3) system from 3.1H and up as well as other mySAP components
        within BAPIs or RFMs (Remote Function Modules).
