<b>General</b>

<img src="Image-7.3.3.png" alt="7.3.3"/>

The General tab provides the field table, a list of the fields from the current table. You can see the Name, the <emphasis> Key field</emphasis> , the <emphasis> SAP-DataType</emphasis> , the <emphasis> PDI-DataType</emphasis> , the  <emphasis> Length</emphasis> and the <emphasis> Description</emphasis> for each field. <emphasis> Convert</emphasis> shows whether the datatype is passed as a string into PDI. Also three Buttons can be found:

    <tr>
    <td>Get Fields</td>
    <td>Click to retrieve a list of all fields coming in on the stream.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Convert Yes</td>
    <td>Convert the data type of every field into Java-Types which are used in PDI.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Convert No</td>
    <td>The type of any field will be not converted.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

>Note: You can also decide individually for each field how you want to proceed with the conversion by using the dropdown menu.

<control>Filter</control>

The filter tab allows to set a filter on SAP-Database level. The entered query is displayed above and the condition is executed on SAP-System side.

<control>Limitations</control>

Loading very large or wide tables can result in a performance decrease as database pointers cannot be maintained by SAP when running in client RFC mode. For loading very large tables consider using Server Mode.

<control>Server Mode</control>

<img src="Image-7.3.3.4.png" alt="7.3.3.4"/>

The Server Mode is considered for bulk loading very large (100M+) SAP tables and provides the currently best performance by exposing an ABAP Remote-RFC Endpoint to the SAP System and triggering a custom function at the SAP System to send the data to the RFC Endpoint (PDI/BA Sever).

Loading data this way allows SAP to maintain pointers and run the extraction process in the same thread ensuring constant performance even with very large tables.
