# Discription

This step allows you to extract data via the XBP interface (<control>E</control>xternal interface for job <control>B</control>ackground <control>P</control>rocessing).

This report step allows data extraction of most standard and user-defined ABAP reports that return a table-like structure or to read spool list of a job that has been run. The ABAP reports are executed in the background in SAP as a batch job and assigned to a job step. A spool list created by the batch job is then read by the report step.

The step supports Metadata Injection.
