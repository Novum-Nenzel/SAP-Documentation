# Installation for Pentaho Server

Before installation for BA server, the steps must be installed in PDI as describe above. You also need:
-	Any combination of (sap-tableinput-x.jar, the sap-rfcexecutor-x.jar, sap-dsoinput-x.jar, 
sap-queryinput-x.jar, sap-reportinput-x.jar, sap-odp-extractor-x.jar)
-	sap-shared-x.jar
-	sap-server-x.jar
-	license-manager-x.jar

Additionally you need the sapjco3 libraries and, just like the installation in PDI, the l4j license files.
You must take the following steps to install the files:

1.	Go to the path of your Pentaho installation into the directory:
<code-block lang="bash"> â€¦/server/pentaho-server/pentaho-solutions/system/kettle/plugins</code-block>
2.	If you are in the plugins folder, the installation is the same as for the PDI Client. Just follow steps 2 and 3 of the instructions in<a href="Step-and-License-Installation-for-PDI.md">chapter 4.1</a>  above.
