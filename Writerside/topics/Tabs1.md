# Tabs

<b>General</b>

<img src="Image-7.2.3.png" alt="7.2.3.1"/>

The General tab provides the field table, splitted in Characteristics and Key Figures. For each you get the fields Name of  <emphasis>InfoObject</emphasis>, <emphasis>SAP DataType</emphasis> and <emphasis>Description</emphasis>.

By using the button Get Fields you retrieve a list of all fields coming in on the stream. Itâ€™s possible to sort or delete fields.

<b>Server Mode</b>

<img src="Image-7.2.3.2.png" alt="7.2.3.2"/>

The Server Mode is considered for bulk loading very large InfoProviders, such as very large DSOs, and provides the currently best performance by exposing a ABAP Remote-RFC Endpoint to the SAP System and triggering a custom function at the SAP System to send the data to the RFC Endpoint (PDI/BA Sever).

Loading data this way allows SAP to maintain pointers and run the extraction process in the same thread ensuring constant performance even with very large tables.
